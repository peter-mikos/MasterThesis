Dead-Line:
- Finish Thesis pretty much by 12.08.2024 and send to Eisenberg for Feedback
- Roughly 40-60 pages including Appendix in font size 12 (or other...)

TO-DO's:
- Find out if it is ok to republish HistData! -> could not find out if it's not ok... But I can just delete it from GitHub
- Review Bühler et. al. Package!
- Write down Results/Conclusions
- Tables: Include some Tables in text to clarify Results and Rest in Appendix
- Plots: same as Tables. Histograms of NN's only in Appendix!

Proposed Structure:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- SABR Model chapter: Model, Delta, Calibration, Simulation
- Neural Network Chapter? No, but Verweis auf Bücher die NNs erklären
- Deep Hedging Chapter: Literature Review, Explaination of Architecture etc.
- "Numerical Study/Results" explaining Code, setup and results... -> main focus!
- Conclusion
