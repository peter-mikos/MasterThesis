Results:
- check if sorting out "extreme" paths makes SABR perform better
-> Not True; most of the time it's quite the opposite: NN performs even better...
- performance on real paths: SABR and BS very consistent, NN inconsistent -> conservative (too much wealth)

ReLu: Dead Neuron-Problem...

Questions:
- When are you on summer holiday?
- How much time will you appr. need for grading?
- When should I submit such that I finish by or in September?
- 40 pages? What is included in the 40 pages?
- Should I create doc-strings for code and comment it out?

Proposed Structure:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Basic Concepts? If at all, which concepts?
- SABR Model chapter: Model, Delta, Calibration, Simulation
- Neural Network Chapter? Verweis auf Bücher die NNs erklären
- Deep Hedging Chapter: Literature Review, Explaination of Architecture etc.
Buehler et al package anschauen
- "Numerical Study/Results" explaining Code, setup and results... -> main focus!
- Conclusion

--> How and where to put Tables? All? Or some and make references to appendix?
--> Plots, what and where should I plot? Real paths? Wealth distributions?
